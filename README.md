# Obstacle Avoidance Robot made using Ardunio

### Abstract

This project showcases a robot car designed to autonomously navigate its environment by avoiding obstacles and following a designated path. Equipped with ultrasonic sensors, the robot car detects and steers clear of obstacles, ensuring smooth movement without collisions. Additionally, it uses infrared (IR) sensors to detect and follow a line, enabling precise path tracking. The combination of ultrasonic waves for obstacle detection and IR rays for line following makes this robot car an efficient and reliable solution for various autonomous navigation tasks. Ideal for educational purposes and hobbyist projects, this repository includes all necessary code, schematics, and detailed instructions for assembly and operation.
